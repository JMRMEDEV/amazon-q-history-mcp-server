# Amazon Q History MCP Server - Progress Log

**Project Start:** 2025-12-05

## 2025-12-05

### Analysis & Planning
- ✅ Conducted deep code analysis of entire codebase
- ✅ Identified 20 issues across critical, medium, and low priority
- ✅ Created comprehensive refactor plan in `docs/refactor.md`
- ✅ Documented all proposed solutions with code examples
- ✅ Established progress tracking system

### Issues Identified
- **Critical (5):** Race conditions, memory leaks, hardcoded paths, input validation, file access control
- **Medium (6):** Logging, file watching, circular dependencies, multi-agent sessions, error handling, backup restoration
- **Low (9):** Context extraction, overflow detection, pagination, caching, timestamps, versioning, documentation

### Completed - Issue #1: Race Conditions 🔴
- ✅ Created `FileOperationQueue` class in `src/file-operation-queue.js`
- ✅ Replaced `isUpdating` flag in `SessionManager` with queue
- ✅ Replaced `isLogging` flag in `WorklogTracker` with queue
- ✅ Removed `isLogging` check from file watcher in `server.js`
- ✅ All file operations now properly queued and executed sequentially
- ✅ Created stress test (`test-race-conditions.js`) with 45 concurrent operations
- ✅ Test passes: 18 prompts + 27 actions logged correctly
- **Result:** No more race conditions or silently dropped operations

#### Issues Found During Implementation
1. **Initial approach failed:** Per-instance queues caused deadlock when nested operations tried to queue themselves
2. **Deadlock scenario:** `logPrompt` queued operation that called `updateGoalsAndCriteria`, which tried to queue another operation
3. **Solution:** Singleton queue shared across all managers, with only top-level operations queued
4. **Key insight:** Nested file operations must run within the parent queued operation, not queue themselves

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Stress test passes with 45 concurrent operations
- ⏳ **Pending:** Real-world testing with kiro-cli MCP server integration
- ⏳ **Pending:** Testing with actual Q CLI agent workflows

#### Files Modified
- `src/file-operation-queue.js` (created)
- `src/session-manager.js` (queue integration)
- `src/worklog-tracker.js` (queue integration)
- `server.js` (removed isLogging check)
- `test-race-conditions.js` (created)

### Completed - Issue #3: Memory Leaks 🔴
- ✅ Added `MAX_TIMERS` limit (1000) for debounce timers
- ✅ Added `MAX_OPERATIONS` limit (100) for active operations
- ✅ Added `OPERATION_TIMEOUT` (5 minutes) for stale operation cleanup
- ✅ Created `addDebounceTimer()` helper with automatic cleanup
- ✅ Created `addActiveOperation()` helper with timeout-based cleanup
- ✅ Updated file watcher to use new helpers
- ✅ Updated hook handler to use new helpers
- ✅ Created stress test (`test-memory-leaks.js`) with 5000 operations
- ✅ Test passes: Memory growth controlled, limits enforced
- **Result:** No unbounded memory growth, automatic cleanup of stale data

#### Implementation Details
- **Debounce timers:** FIFO eviction when limit reached
- **Active operations:** Timeout-based cleanup (removes ops older than 5min)
- **Memory impact:** ~4MB increase under 5000 operation load (controlled)

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Stress test passes with 5000 operations
- ✅ Limits enforced: 1000 timers max, 100 operations max
- ✅ Stale operation cleanup verified
- ⏳ **Pending:** Real-world testing with kiro-cli MCP server integration

#### Files Modified
- `server.js` (added limits, helpers, exported class)
- `test-memory-leaks.js` (created)

### Completed - Issue #6: Portable Paths 🔴
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded `/tmp/amazon-q-history` with `os.tmpdir()`
- ✅ Added `import os from 'os'` to session-manager.js
- ✅ Backup directory now uses `join(os.tmpdir(), 'amazon-q-history')`
- ✅ Created test (`test-portable-paths.js`) to verify cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Test passes on Linux (will work on Windows and macOS)
- **Result:** MCP server now works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### Platform-Specific Paths
- **Linux/macOS:** `/tmp/amazon-q-history`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\amazon-q-history`

#### Testing Status
- ✅ Test passes on Linux
- ⏳ **Pending:** Testing on Windows and macOS
- ⏳ **Pending:** Real-world testing with kiro-cli

#### Files Modified
- `src/session-manager.js` (replaced hardcoded path)
- `test-portable-paths.js` (created)

### Next Steps
- Issue #9: Input validation
- Issue #10: File access control
- Real-world testing with kiro-cli for Issues #1, #3, and #6
